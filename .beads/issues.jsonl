No explicit return type was declared\n2. TypeScript allows `\u003e` and `\u003c` operators on any values\n\nIf we had explicit return types, TypeScript would ERROR when the inferred type doesn't match the declared type.\n\n## Example\n```typescript\n// Without return type - silently infers wrong union type\nconst getTemperatureFromRoom = (room: {...}) =\u003e\n  pipe(room.temperature, Option.getOrElse(() =\u003e VeryHot));  // Returns { temperature: T } | Effect\u003c...\u003e\n\n// With return type - TypeScript ERROR\\!\nconst getTemperatureFromRoom = (room: {...}): { temperature: Temperature } =\u003e\n  pipe(room.temperature, Option.getOrElse(() =\u003e VeryHot));  // TS2322: Type '... | Effect\u003c...\u003e' is not assignable\n```\n\n## Implementation\n1.

{"id":"dh-d41","title":"trvScheduledTargetTemperatures$ only emits for last TRV, blocking heating for other rooms","description":"## Summary\n\nOnly one TRV (the last one to emit a schedule update at startup) receives `trvScheduledTargetTemperature` values. This blocks the `combineLatest` in `trvActions.ts` from emitting for all other TRVs, meaning no heating actions are generated for most rooms.\n\n## Observed Behaviour\n\n- All TRVs report their status at startup (\"is set to heat 15\")\n- Room target temperatures are calculated correctly (\"Living Area should be 18.2\", etc.)\n- \"Some rooms are heating\" appears (from `roomDecisionPoints$`)\n- But only ONE room (typically Office, the last TRV to report) gets TRV actions\n- Other rooms remain at their initial low temperature (15°C) instead of being commanded to heat\n\n## Root Cause\n\nIn `packages/deep-heating-rx/src/lib/streams/trvs/trvScheduledTargetTemperatures.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nexport const getTrvScheduledTargetTemperatures = (\n  trvHiveHeatingSchedule$: Observable\u003cTrvWeekHeatingSchedule\u003e,\n): Observable\u003cTrvScheduledTargetTemperature\u003e =\u003e\n  combineLatest([\n    trvHiveHeatingSchedule$,  // ← Single stream emitting one TRV at a time\n    timer(0, refreshIntervalSeconds * 1000).pipe(map(localNow), shareReplay(1)),\n  ]).pipe(\n    map(([trvSchedule, now]) =\u003e ({ ... })),\n    shareReplayLatestDistinctByKey((x) =\u003e x.climateEntityId),\n  );\n```\n\nThe `combineLatest` operator stores only the LATEST value from `trvHiveHeatingSchedule$`. When the timer fires (including at t=0), it combines with that single latest value and emits ONE `TrvScheduledTargetTemperature`.\n\nThe `shareReplayLatestDistinctByKey` at the end stores values by `climateEntityId`, but since only one value is emitted per timer tick, only one TRV ever gets stored.\n\n## Impact Chain\n\n1. `trvScheduledTargetTemperatures$` only has data for one TRV\n2. In `trvActions.ts` (line 97-105), `combineLatest` waits for 4 streams per TRV:\n   - `trvDesiredTargetTemperatures` ✅\n   - `trvControlStates` ✅\n   - `trvTemperatures` ✅\n   - `trvScheduledTargetTemperatures` ❌ (never emits for most TRVs)\n3. The `combineLatest` never completes for TRVs missing scheduled target data\n4. No `ClimateAction` is generated for those TRVs\n5. Those rooms never heat\n\n## Affected Files\n\n- `packages/deep-heating-rx/src/lib/streams/trvs/trvScheduledTargetTemperatures.ts` - Root cause\n- `packages/deep-heating-rx/src/lib/streams/trvs/trvActions.ts` - Consumer that blocks\n- `packages/deep-heating-rx/src/lib/streams/actions.ts` - Another consumer using `withLatestFrom`\n\n## Expected Behaviour\n\nWhen the 60-second timer fires (and at t=0), the stream should emit a `TrvScheduledTargetTemperature` for EVERY TRV that has reported a schedule, not just the most recent one.\n\n## Reproduction\n\n1. Start Deep Heating with multiple rooms/TRVs\n2. Observe startup logs - all TRVs report \"is set to heat\"\n3. Observe room targets are calculated\n4. Note that only ONE TRV gets \"will be changed to heat\" commands\n5. Other rooms remain cold\n\n## Related\n\nThis is similar to the bug fixed in PR #1178 (see CHANGELOG entry about `shareReplayLatestDistinctByKey` for scheduled targets), but that fix was for room-level scheduling.

{"id":"dh-d5q","title":"TRV target temperature timer only recalculates last TRV","description":"## Summary\n\nThe 60-second periodic timer in `trvDesiredTargetTemperatures.ts` only triggers recalculation for the **last TRV that emitted** a decision point. Other TRVs in the system don't get periodic recalculation, causing their target temperatures to become stale.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nIn `packages/deep-heating-rx/src/lib/streams/trvs/trvDesiredTargetTemperatures.ts:53-56`:\n\n```typescript\ncombineLatest([\n  trvDecisionPoints,  // emits individual TRV decision points\n  timer(0, refreshIntervalSeconds * 1000),\n])\n```\n\nThe `trvDecisionPoints` stream emits **individual** `TrvDecisionPoint` objects - one per TRV when room data changes. When `combineLatest` receives these, it only remembers the **latest** value from the stream.\n\n### The Bug Flow\n\n1. Living Area room updates → emits Lounge TRV decision point\n2. Living Area room updates → emits Kitchen TRV decision point  \n3. `combineLatest` now holds: `[kitchenDecisionPoint, 0]`\n4. Timer ticks (60s later)\n5. `combineLatest` emits: `[kitchenDecisionPoint, 1]`\n6. **Only Kitchen gets recalculated!**\n7. **Lounge is NOT recalculated** - its target temperature becomes stale\n\n## Symptoms\n\n- TRV target temperatures don't adjust as TRV internal sensor readings change\n- The offset calculation `roomTarget + trvInternalTemp - roomTemp` uses stale `trvInternalTemp`\n- TRVs may sit idle when they should be heating because target is too low\n- Observed: Lounge TRV at 24.5°C target when calculation with fresh data would give 27°C\n\n## Impact\n\nWhen a TRV's internal temperature sensor rises (e.g., from 22°C to 24°C), the system should increase the TRV target to compensate. But if that TRV wasn't the last one to emit, its target stays at the old value calculated with 22°C.\n\nThis causes the TRV to stop heating prematurely because:\n- TRV target: 24.5°C (stale calculation)\n- TRV internal sensor: 24°C\n- Hysteresis means TRV thinks it's \"close enough\" and sits idle\n- Room stays cold at 18°C instead of reaching 20°C target\n\n## Data Flow Context\n\nFrom the TRV temperature data flow:\n1. `trvApiUpdates$` → `trvTemperatures$` \n2. `trvTemperatures$` → `roomTrvTemperatures$`\n3. `roomTrvTemperatures$` → `roomDecisionPoints$`\n4. `roomDecisionPoints$` → `trvDecisionPoints$` (emits per-TRV)\n5. `trvDecisionPoints$` → `trvDesiredTargetTemperatures$` ← **BUG HERE**\n\n## Possible Fixes\n\n1. **Move timer upstream**: Add timer to `trvDecisionPoints.ts` so each TRV gets periodic re-emit via the `shareReplayLatestDistinctByKey` cache replay\n\n2. **Use merge + withLatestFrom**: Instead of `combineLatest`, use the timer to trigger replay of ALL cached TRV decision points\n\n3. **Remove timer entirely**: If upstream streams already have timers for schedule changes, the timer here may be redundant\n\n## Files Affected\n\n- `packages/deep-heating-rx/src/lib/streams/trvs/trvDesiredTargetTemperatures.ts` - contains the buggy timer\n- `packages/deep-heating-rx/src/lib/streams/trvs/trvDecisionPoints.ts` - emits individual TRV decision points","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-04T16:58:49.370517Z","updated_at":"2025-12-04T16:58:49.370517Z"}

{"id":"dh-f4v","title":"Separate web build derivation to eliminate manual shebang patching","description":"## Problem\n\nThe current approach in PR #1156 uses manual `sed` patching of shebangs in `bunNodeModulesInstallPhase` to replace `#!/usr/bin/env node` with bun. This works but is hacky.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nWe can't use `bun install --production` because vite (a devDependency) is needed to build the SvelteKit web frontend. This forces us to install all devDeps, which means tools with node shebangs need patching to work in the Nix sandbox.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nFollow automatarr's pattern more closely by splitting the build:\n\n1. **Separate web build derivation** with full devDeps\n   - Uses `patchShebangs = true` (or manual patching)\n   - Runs vite build for SvelteKit\n   - Outputs only the built web assets\n\n2. **Main deep-heating derivation** with production deps only\n   - Uses `bun install --production`\n   - Uses `patchShebangs = false` (no shebangs to patch in prod deps)\n   - Bundles server with `bun build`\n   - Copies pre-built web assets from step 1\n\nThis eliminates:\n- Manual sed patching in the main build\n- Any risk of devDep tooling leaking into runtime closure\n\n## Benefits\n\n- Cleaner separation of build-time vs runtime dependencies\n- More confidence that runtime closure is minimal\n- Follows the pattern proven in automatarr\n\n## Depends On\n\nPR #1156 should merge first (establishes TypeScript-native builds), then this can be a follow-up improvement.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-02T08:37:08.386744Z","updated_at":"2025-12-02T16:40:52.283484Z","closed_at":"2025-12-02T16:40:52.283484Z","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"dh-f4v","depends_on_id":"dh-akk","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-02T08:37:13.915622Z","created_by":"daemon"}]}

The TRV returns with a stale/default temperature and the room stays cold.\n\n## Observed Behavior (2025-12-04)\n\n- **09:12:10** - Lounge radiator \"Became unavailable\" (Zigbee dropout)\n- **09:16:40** - Lounge radiator \"Changed to Heat\" (came back online)\n- **09:30:18** - Deep Heating addon restarted\n- Lounge TRV reported target of 20°C (stale value)\n- Kitchen TRV (same Living Area room) was at 24°C and heating correctly\n- Room temperature was 16.56°C, target was 20°C\n- System calculated \"Living Area should be 20\" but never sent \"will be changed\" for lounge\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe action generation pipeline in `getTrvActions` uses `combineLatest` with 4 streams:\n1. `trvDesiredTargetTemperatures` - what the TRV should be set to\n2. `trvControlStates` - what the TRV is currently set to (from device)\n3. `trvTemperatures` - TRV's own temperature reading\n4. `trvScheduledTargetTemperatures` - TRV's schedule\n\nCombined with `distinctUntilChanged(isDeepStrictEqual)` on line 90-97, if the calculated desired temperature matches what the device reports, no action is emitted.\n\nThe 60-second timer in `getTrvDesiredTargetTemperatures` should eventually trigger recalculation, but:\n- `shareReplayLatestDistinctByKey` suppresses emissions if the calculated value is the same\n- The action comparison in `determineAction()` returns `null` if desired === current\n\n## Why Local Server Fixed It\n\nWhen running locally, the server connected fresh to Home Assistant and received all current state. The `combineLatest` fired with all values available simultaneously, and the mismatch was detected (lounge at 20°C but should be ~22.5°C based on room temp differential).\n\n## Potential Fixes\n\n1. **Track availability transitions**: When a TRV transitions from unavailable → available, force re-evaluation regardless of cached values\n2. **Don't suppress identical desired temps**: Remove or modify the `distinctUntilChanged` in the action pipeline\n3. **Compare against device state, not cached state**: Ensure actions are generated when device state differs from desired, even if desired hasn't changed\n4. **Periodic forced re-push**: On a longer interval (5-10 min), force re-send all TRV targets regardless of change detection\n\n## Key Files\n\n- `packages/deep-heating-rx/src/lib/streams/trvs/trvActions.ts` - Action generation with combineLatest\n- `packages/deep-heating-rx/src/lib/streams/trvs/trvDesiredTargetTemperatures.ts` - Desired temp calculation with 60s timer\n- `packages/deep-heating-rx/src/lib/streams/DeepHeating.ts` - Stream wiring and subscriptions\n- `packages/deep-heating-home-assistant/` - Where availability state would be tracked","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-04T14:46:38.166614Z","updated_at":"2025-12-04T15:20:51.058907Z","closed_at":"2025-12-04T15:20:51.058907Z"}

This caused Docker builds to hang for 46+ minutes until manually cancelled.\n\n## Root Cause\n\n**Single-user Nix on GitHub Actions has the sandbox DISABLED** because:\n- The sandbox requires either root (daemon) or user namespaces\n- GitHub Actions runners don't provide these for non-root users\n- Without sandbox, builds run in `/tmp/nix-build-...` instead of `/build/`\n\n## Evidence\n\n| Aspect | Successful Build (before #1223) | Failed Build (after #1223) |\n|--------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Installer | cachix/install-nix-action | nixbuild/nix-quick-install-action |\n| Mode | Multi-user (daemon) | Single-user (no daemon) |\n| Sandbox | ENABLED | DISABLED |\n| Build dir | /build/... | /tmp/nix-build-... |\n| Lifecycle msg | 'no network in sandbox' ✓ | (missing) |\n\n## Failure Sequence\n\n1. Without sandbox, environment differs from bun2nix expectations\n2. Bun lockfile parsing fails: `Failed to resolve peer dependency '@effect/cluster'`\n3. Bun falls back to resolving packages fresh\n4. Bun tries to write to cache: `EACCES: Permission denied (rename())`\n5. Build hangs indefinitely\n\n## Fix\n\nUse split approach:\n- **CI jobs** (ci.yml, release.yml, sync-bun-nix.yml): Keep `nix-quick-install-action` + `cache-nix-action` for fast cached builds\n- **Docker builds** (docker.yml): Use `cachix/install-nix-action` directly for multi-user mode with sandbox enabled\n\nThis gives us:\n- Fast cached CI for regular jobs (38% improvement retained)\n- Working Docker builds with proper sandbox isolation (~6-7 minutes)\n\n## Future Enhancement\n\nSee bead dh-b4l for evaluating Cachix service to add caching to Docker builds while keeping sandbox enabled.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-11T07:25:14.712654Z","updated_at":"2025-12-12T18:08:13.333852Z","closed_at":"2025-12-12T16:53:52.68719Z"}
