## Your task

This command automates the entire process of getting changes merged into main:

1. **Check current git status** - Determine if there are uncommitted changes
2. **Handle uncommitted changes** (if any):
   - Check if already on a feature branch, if not create one
3. **Run checks**
   - Run `gleam build && gleam test` from `packages/deep_heating` to ensure all tests pass before proceeding
   - Fix any issues if checks fail
   - Assume all failures are due to your changes, not external factors
4. **Create a changeset file** (if changes affect the package)
   - Manually create a new changeset file in `.changeset/` with a summary of changes and type of release (patch or minor only, because we are still pre-1.0.0)
   - Changes must be described from the perspective of a user of the package, not internal implementation details
   - Skip this step if changes don't affect published packages (e.g., CI/workflow changes only)
5. **Commit and push changes** to the feature branch
   - Stage and commit all relevant changes (ignoring unrelated changes) with an appropriate commit message
   - Push the branch to origin
6. **Check for existing PR**:
   - If PR already exists for current branch, ensure it's up to date
   - If no PR exists, create one with a descriptive title and body
7. **Enable automerge** on the PR (squash merge)
8. **Monitor the PR** until it's merged:
   - Use `gh pr checks --watch` to wait for checks to complete
   - After checks pass, verify merge status
   - Alert when merged successfully or if merge fails
9. **Clean up** after successful merge:
   - Checkout main: `git checkout main`
   - Pull latest changes: `git pull origin main`
   - Delete the local feature branch: `git branch -d {branch-name}`

## Important notes

- If on main branch with uncommitted changes, create a feature branch first
- Use conventional commit format for commit messages
- PR title should follow conventional commits format
- Monitor and report PR check statuses while waiting
- Only proceed with cleanup after successful merge
- If merge fails, report the failure reason and leave branch intact for debugging
