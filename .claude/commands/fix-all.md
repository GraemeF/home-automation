# Your Task

Iteratively fix all issues shown by `turbo all` one file at a time until the build passes completely.

## Instructions

You are orchestrating a complex multi-file fix operation. Your job is to:

1. **Run `turbo all`** to identify the first failing file
2. **Delegate to the effect-pro agent** to fix that specific file
3. **Commit the changes** after each successful fix
4. **Repeat** until `turbo all` completes successfully

## Critical Rules for Agents

When delegating to agents, you MUST include these instructions:

### Scope

- Fix ONLY the specific file assigned to you
- Do NOT modify any other files unless absolutely necessary
- If you need to modify another file, report back first

### Strict Lint Rules

This codebase enforces extremely strict functional programming rules enforced by lint. These rules are to ensure we have readable, functional code. Use function names carefully to aid readability.

### Verification

- Run `turbo all` repeatedly until YOUR file is no longer the source of errors (typecheck, lint, or test failures).
- NO OTHER COMMANDS ARE PERMITTED. Only `turbo all`.
- The next file may fail - that's expected and will be handled by the next agent
- Ensure your fixes don't break other files (watch for import changes, type changes, etc.)

### Testing Exclusions

Note: Files matching these patterns have relaxed rules:

- `**/*.test.ts`, `**/*.spec.ts`
- `**/testing/**/*.ts`
- `**/eventsourcing-testing-contracts/**/*.ts`

## Orchestration Strategy

### Detecting Ping-Pong

Watch for agents repeatedly breaking each other's files. Signs include:

- Same 2-3 files alternating in error list
- Type signature changes causing cascading failures
- Import/export changes affecting multiple files

### Handling Ping-Pong

If you detect ping-pong:

1. **Stop the iteration**
2. **Analyze the root cause** - usually a shared type or interface
3. **Create a coordinated fix plan** - fix the root cause first, then dependents
4. **Guide the agent explicitly** - "Fix X without changing the signature of Y"

### Progress Tracking

Use the TodoWrite tool to track:

- Which files have been fixed
- Which files are currently failing
- Any ping-pong patterns detected
- Overall progress toward clean build

## Exit Condition

Stop when `turbo all` completes with exit code 0 and shows:

```
Tasks: X successful, X total
```

With no error messages.
