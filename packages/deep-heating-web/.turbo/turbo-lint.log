Oops! Something went wrong! :(

ESLint: 8.57.1

ESLint couldn't find the plugin "@nx/eslint-plugin".

(The package "@nx/eslint-plugin" was not found when loaded as a Node module from the directory "/Users/graemefoster/Development/home-automation/packages/deep-heating-web".)

It's likely that the plugin isn't installed correctly. Try reinstalling by running the following:

    npm install @nx/eslint-plugin@latest --save-dev

The plugin "@nx/eslint-plugin" was referenced from the config file in ".eslintrc.cjs#overrides[1]".

If you still can't figure out the problem, please stop by https://eslint.org/chat/help to chat with the team.
